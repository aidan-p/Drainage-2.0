# Drainage 2.0
A battery capacity testing program that allows you to estimate how long your laptop battery should last under different amounts of load.

This is a continuation of my original Drainage program that is being developed using QT to create a graphical interface for users.

PLEASE NOTE: Drainage 2.0 is not yet finished, some issues can be expeceted.

## To-do
- [ ] Add a progress bar to represent how much longer the test will run for
- [ ] Add calculations to estimate the duration of a full charge
- [ ] Look into potentially moving to Qthread rather than std::thread (potentially performance differences?)
